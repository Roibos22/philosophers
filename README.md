# philosophers

The "Philosophers project is an exercise in which students at the 42 coding school tackle the classic concurrency problem known as the Dining Philosophers. Students must write a program in C that simulates multiple philosophers sitting at a round table, sharing forks, and alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping. The challenge is to prevent deadlocks and ensure that no philosopher starves, thereby managing shared resources and threading effectively. It serves as a practical lesson in the use of threads, mutexes, semaphores, and process synchronization.
